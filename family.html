      <b>AEETES</b>, king of Cholchis during the Argonautic expedition, was son
      of Perseis by the Sun, brother of Circe, husband of <b>Idyaia</b>,
      daughter of Oceanus, and father of Absyrtus, Calciope, and <b>Medea</b>,
      mother of Medus by Jason. Some authors make him also father of Pasiphae,
      and grandfather of Phaedra, the dissolute wives of Minos and Theseus.
      Banier thinks, with many of the ancients, that Aeetes was slain in an
      engagement on the Euxine sea, betwixt the Colchian fleet and that of the
      Argonauts under Jason. It must be observed that there were two kings of
      Colchis of the name of Aeetes, as well as two Circes, the first having
      reigned in the time of the Argonauts, and the second after the war of
      Troy. Aeetes the first, was brother of Circe by the Sun; Aeetes the
      second, brother of the second Circe, daughter of the former, and
      grand-daughter of Helius ; she who reigned over the coasts of Italy, and
      at whose court Ulysses abode, about the time of the Trojan war.
